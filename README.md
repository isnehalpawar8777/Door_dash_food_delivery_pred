# Door_dash_food_delivery_pred
This is a project regarding door dash food delivery time prediction.

Firstly here we got the data from stratastracth on which we have to build a predictive model to predict the delivery duration of food items.

Get the data
We need to import all the necessary libraries
Explore and clean the data
Feature selection
feature extraction
split the data and build a model on training data
test the model
deploy the model and communicate the results
We Have to Build a model to predict the total delivery duration in seconds for DoorDash, It is very important for DoorDash to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer experience. In this project we will build a model to predict the estimated time taken for a delivery.

We have the historical data from DoorDash and following are the features of our dataset:

Start: the time consumer submits the order (created_at)
